                What is EvoNaplo, you may ask?<br>
                EvoNaplo is an online diary for Evosoft's talent program: EvoCampus.
            </p>
            <p>
             The EvoCampus talent program offers a place for developers to learn new skills and perfect the skills they already posess.<br>
              It is a great place to learn new things from web to software developement and all other skills. Learning is done through
              simulated projects, which are proposed by Evosoft or the students.<br>
              For the projects the students form a team and get assigned one or more mentors.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of each semester, students showcase what they learned,
                 how they figured out the details of the projects and what they are planning to do in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our project, EvoNaplo, strives to administrate all aspects of this talent program, from students,
                through projects to attandances and reviews and a lot more.<br>
                While creating this much of EvoNaplo, we have already learned a tremendous amount and we hope to continue building, developing
                and perfecting this website, and in the meantime of course: learn a lot :)
